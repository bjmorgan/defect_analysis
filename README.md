# Site Analysis Tools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjmorgan/site_analysis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjmorgan/site_analysis)

This repository contains software tools for analysing crystal structures and molecular dynamics trajectories in terms of lattice-site occupations.

## Tools:

- `chains.rb`.
- `defectid`
- `polyhedra`: Analyses a crystal structure to find polyhedra defined by a sub-lattice.
- `defect_sort`
- `site_occupation.rb`
- `site_site`
- `vacancy_sort`
