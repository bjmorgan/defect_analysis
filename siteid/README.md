# siteid

D. Marrocchelli  
B. J. Morgan

Analyse a molecular dynamics trajectory to identify the sites occupied by mobile ions.

Reads in a simulation trajectory, and assigns ions to lattice sites for each frame.
Lattice sites can be defined as coordination octahedra or tetrahedra (calculated on the
fly using the sub-lattice geometry for each frame) or as spherical sites with fixed
centres (TODO: spherical sites are not implemented yet).

TODO: allowing for flexible site types might be a way to have e.g. two sets of tetrahdral sites (cf. up and down)

## inputs

TODO: document what inputs are needed.

- `defect_new.inpt` TODO: change name to `siteid.inpt`.

TODO: Other inputs? At present:
- file containing list of Cartesian coordinates (e.g. `poscart.out`)
- file containing list of cell geometries (cell lengths and matrices) (e.g. `cell_matrix.out`)
- input files that define polyhedra (e.g. `tet.list` and `oct.list`).

### `oct.list` and `tet.list`

The `*.list` input files define polyhedra of each type (octahedra and tetrahedra). Each line in the file contains N integers corresponding to the atom index for the vertices of that polyhedron. e.g. for tetrahedra:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 5 6
1 3 7 8
â€¦
```
Note that the index for each species in `siteid` counts from 1.

### example input

TODO: this will need to be restructured to allow for more flexible site types

## outputs

### to stdout

### output files

`sites_atoms.dat`: atom numbers occupying each site (NOTE: what happens in cases of multiple occupancy?) Empty sites are denoted `0`.
`atoms_sites.dat`: site numbers for each ion (NOTE: what happens if an atom is not assigned to a site?)
`npolyocc.dat`: Numbers of polyhedral types occupied. TODO: this should be more general to include all site types, and also write number of atoms not assigned to sites.

## History

This code was developed out of a series of codes written to identify defects in close-packed
structures. The first version was written by D. Marrocchelli during his DPhil, to identify vacant tetrahedra in fluorite-structured oxide-ion conductors \[1\]. TODO: add other Dario references.
This was adapted to identify octahedral defects in close-packed structured by D. Marrocchelli and B. J. Morgan \[2,3,4\], using the property that in a close-packed structure the set of tetrahedra and octahedra are space-filling, and any ion not in a tetrahedral site must occupy an octahedral site. 
The code was subsequently revised by B. J. Morgan to assign polyhedral occupations in non-close-packed lattices \[5\].
TODO: Addition of spherical site types (as fixed coordinates / centroids of sets of atoms?).
